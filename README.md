#Olympic Games Dataset Analysis with SQL




1) Overview:
This project analyzes the Olympic Games dataset spanning from 1896 to 2016 using SQL queries. The dataset, sourced from the Olympic Games on Kaggle, provides comprehensive information about athletes, events, and medal outcomes across various Olympic Games.

2) Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to explore and derive insights from the Olympic Games dataset using SQL queries. By leveraging SQL, we aim to perform various analyses and gain deeper understanding into the historical trends, athlete performances, medal distributions, and other relevant aspects of the Olympic Games.

3) Dataset:
The dataset used in this project, athlete_events.csv, contains detailed information about athletes, including their names, countries, events participated in, medals won, and the year of participation. With over a century's worth of data, it provides a rich resource for analyzing the dynamics of the Olympic Games over time.
